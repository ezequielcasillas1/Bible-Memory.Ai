## ðŸ”¹ Standard Commit Flow

Every time a feature or file is added/updated: {IMPORTANT RIGHT AFTER ADDING COMMIT, DO NOT PUSH, UNTIL I VERIFY THAT IT IS WORKING, I WILL 
LET YOU KNOW IF IT DOES NOT WORK, AND IF IT DOES NOT WORK THEN ILL LET YOU KNOW BY TELLING YOU
TO PUT IN THE UPDATED COMMIT WITH THE TITLE/DESCRIPTION: DOES NOT WORK. THEN FEEL FREE TO ALWAYS PUSH IT AFTERWARDS}

```bash
# 1. Sync with remote first
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Stage all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "BMx.x <FEATURE SUMMARY>"

# 4. Push to remote main
git push origin main
