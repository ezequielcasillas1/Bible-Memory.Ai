{Mission Briefing: Type-Along Mode Complete Overhaul
You will now execute this request in full compliance with your AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER - OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE. Each phase is mandatory. Deviations are not permitted.
Phase 0: Reconnaissance & Mental Modeling (Read-Only)
Directive: Perform a non-destructive scan of the Type-Along practice mode in SyntaxLabPage.tsx to understand the current broken implementation where users are forced to type single words instead of complete verses.
Output: Produce a concise analysis of the current Type-Along mode flow and identify all components that need modification.
Constraint: No mutations are permitted during this phase.
Phase 1: Planning & Strategy
Directive: Based on your reconnaissance, formulate a clear plan to completely overhaul Type-Along mode.
Core Requirements:
Complete Verse Input: Type-Along mode must allow users to type the ENTIRE verse in one input field, not individual words
Real-Time Synthesis Checking: As the user types the complete verse, provide real-time feedback showing accuracy/progress
Remove "Check Word" Button: Replace with "üéâ Next Verse" button that appears after verse completion
Add Results Summary: Add "üìä View Results" button that shows cumulative performance across all verses practiced in the session
Multi-Verse Session: Allow users to practice multiple verses consecutively in one Type-Along session
Phase 2: Execution & Implementation
Directive: Execute the complete Type-Along mode overhaul with these specific changes:
A. Verse Input System:
Change from single-word input to full verse textarea/input
Implement real-time verse comparison as user types (character-by-character or word-by-word highlighting)
Show typing accuracy percentage in real-time
Display the target verse with visual indicators for correct/incorrect sections
B. Button System Overhaul:
REMOVE: "Check Word" button entirely
ADD: "üéâ Next Verse" button (only appears when verse is completed with >80% accuracy)
ADD: "üìä View Results" button (greyed out/disabled until user completes at least one verse, then becomes active)
ADD: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skip Verse" button (in case user wants to move on)
C. Session Management:
Track multiple verses in a single Type-Along session
Store accuracy, time, and performance data for each verse
Implement verse progression system (auto-generate or select from curated list)
Track completion state to enable/disable "View Results" button
D. Results Dashboard:
Create comprehensive results view showing:
Total verses attempted
Average accuracy across all verses
Time spent per verse
Improvement trends
Weak word identification across all verses
Phase 3: Verification & Testing
Directive: Test the complete Type-Along workflow:
Start Type-Along mode ‚Üí "View Results" button should be greyed out/disabled
Type complete verse ‚Üí should show real-time feedback
Complete verse ‚Üí "Next Verse" button should appear AND "View Results" button should become enabled
Click "Next Verse" ‚Üí should load new verse
Click "View Results" ‚Üí should show comprehensive session data
Phase 4: UI/UX Consistency
Directive: Ensure the new Type-Along mode follows the existing design patterns:
Use gradient backgrounds and modern styling consistent with current buttons
Implement smooth animations and transitions
Maintain the purple/indigo color scheme for Type-Along mode
Add floating emoji feedback for correct/incorrect verse completion
Button States: Ensure disabled "View Results" button has proper grey/disabled styling that matches the app's design system
Phase 5: Final Report & Verdict
Report Structure:
Changes Applied: Complete list of modified components and new features
Verification Evidence: Screenshots or descriptions of the new Type-Along workflow
Performance Metrics: Confirmation that multi-verse sessions work correctly
Final Verdict: System state verification
Success Criteria:
‚úÖ Type-Along mode accepts complete verse input (not single words)
‚úÖ Real-time synthesis checking shows typing accuracy
‚úÖ "Next Verse" button replaces "Check Word" button
‚úÖ "View Results" button is disabled until first verse completion, then becomes active
‚úÖ Multi-verse sessions work seamlessly
‚úÖ UI maintains design consistency with existing components
‚úÖ No regressions in Fill-in-blank mode functionality}

## **Mission Briefing: Standard Operating Protocol**

You will now execute this request in full compliance with your **AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER - OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE.** Each phase is mandatory. Deviations are not permitted.

---

## **Phase 0: Reconnaissance & Mental Modeling (Read-Only)**

-   **Directive:** Perform a non-destructive scan of the entire repository to build a complete, evidence-based mental model of the current system architecture, dependencies, and established patterns.
-   **Output:** Produce a concise digest (‚â§ 200 lines) of your findings. This digest will anchor all subsequent actions.
-   **Constraint:** **No mutations are permitted during this phase.**

---

## **Phase 1: Planning & Strategy**

-   **Directive:** Based on your reconnaissance, formulate a clear, incremental execution plan.
-   **Plan Requirements:**
    1.  **Restate Objectives:** Clearly define the success criteria for this request.
    2.  **Identify Full Impact Surface:** Enumerate **all** files, components, services, and user workflows that will be directly or indirectly affected. This is a test of your system-wide thinking.
    3.  **Justify Strategy:** Propose a technical approach. Explain *why* it is the best choice, considering its alignment with existing patterns, maintainability, and simplicity.
-   **Constraint:** Invoke the **Clarification Threshold** from your Doctrine only if you encounter a critical ambiguity that cannot be resolved through further research.

---

## **Phase 2: Execution & Implementation**

-   **Directive:** Execute your plan incrementally. Adhere strictly to all protocols defined in your **Operational Doctrine.**
-   **Core Protocols in Effect:**
    -   **Read-Write-Reread:** For every file you modify, you must read it immediately before and immediately after the change.
    -   **Command Execution Canon:** All shell commands must be executed using the mandated safety wrapper.
    -   **Workspace Purity:** All transient analysis and logs remain in-chat. No unsolicited files.
    -   **System-Wide Ownership:** If you modify a shared component, you are **MANDATED** to identify and update **ALL** its consumers in this same session.

---

## **Phase 3: Verification & Autonomous Correction**

-   **Directive:** Rigorously validate your changes with fresh, empirical evidence.
-   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Execute all relevant quality gates (unit tests, integration tests, linters, etc.).
    2.  If any gate fails, you will **autonomously diagnose and fix the failure,** reporting the cause and the fix.
    3.  Perform end-to-end testing of the primary user workflow(s) affected by your changes.

---

## **Phase 4: Mandatory Zero-Trust Self-Audit**

-   **Directive:** Your primary implementation is complete, but your work is **NOT DONE.** You will now reset your thinking and conduct a skeptical, zero-trust audit of your own work. Your memory is untrustworthy; only fresh evidence is valid.
-   **Audit Protocol:**
    1.  **Re-verify Final State:** With fresh commands, confirm the Git status is clean, all modified files are in their intended final state, and all relevant services are running correctly.
    2.  **Hunt for Regressions:** Explicitly test at least one critical, related feature that you did *not* directly modify to ensure no unintended side effects were introduced.
    3.  **Confirm System-Wide Consistency:** Double-check that all consumers of any changed component are working as expected.

---

## **Phase 5: Final Report & Verdict**

-   **Directive:** Conclude your mission with a single, structured report.
-   **Report Structure:**
    -   **Changes Applied:** A list of all created or modified artifacts.
    -   **Verification Evidence:** The commands and outputs from your autonomous testing and self-audit, proving the system is healthy.
    -   **System-Wide Impact Statement:** A confirmation that all identified dependencies have been checked and are consistent.
    -   **Final Verdict:** Conclude with one of the two following statements, exactly as written:
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. System state is verified and consistent. No regressions identified. Mission accomplished."`
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND. Halting work. [Describe issue and recommend immediate diagnostic steps]."`
-   **Constraint:** Maintain an inline TODO ledger using ‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / üöß markers throughout the process.
