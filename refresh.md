CRITICAL BUG: Fill-in-blank Spanish translation system has TWO major issues:

1. WORD COMPLETION MISMATCH: When user types Spanish word "esto" for English "all", the system accepts it as correct (isCorrect: true) and adds "esto" to wordsFixed array, but the blank doesn't get marked as completed visually because the completion matching logic compares Spanish "esto" against English text containing "all" - they don't match so blank stays active.

2. WRONG WORD ORDER: Fill-in-blank system creates blanks based on English word positions even when displaying Spanish translation. User sees Spanish "Y sabemos QUE en todas..." but system expects English word "know" at position 2, causing "que" to appear in wrong position in the sequence. VISUAL EVIDENCE: When user types "que", the UI shows it highlighted in purple/blue in the MIDDLE of the verse "Y sabemos _____ en todas _____ cosas _____ Dios trabaja para _____ bien de aquellos _____ lo aman, que han sido _____" instead of filling the FIRST blank after "sabemos". The system should follow left-to-right progression but "que" appears as the 6th word instead of the 1st blank.

ROOT CAUSE: The fillInBlankResult is created using English verse text and English wrong words, but when translation is active, the system should create blanks based on Spanish verse text with Spanish word positions. The completion matching should compare Spanish completed words against Spanish verse text, not English.

FIX NEEDED: Create translation-aware fill-in-blank system that uses translated verse text for both blank creation AND completion matching when translation is detected.

## **Mission Briefing: Root Cause Analysis & Remediation Protocol**

Previous, simpler attempts to resolve this issue have failed. Standard procedures are now suspended. You will initiate a **deep diagnostic protocol.**

Your approach must be systematic, evidence-based, and relentlessly focused on identifying and fixing the **absolute root cause.** Patching symptoms is a critical failure.

---

## **Phase 0: Reconnaissance & State Baseline (Read-Only)**

-   **Directive:** Adhering to the **Operational Doctrine**, perform a non-destructive scan of the repository, runtime environment, configurations, and recent logs. Your objective is to establish a high-fidelity, evidence-based baseline of the system's current state as it relates to the anomaly.
-   **Output:** Produce a concise digest (‚â§ 200 lines) of your findings.
-   **Constraint:** **No mutations are permitted during this phase.**

---

## **Phase 1: Isolate the Anomaly**

-   **Directive:** Your first and most critical goal is to create a **minimal, reproducible test case** that reliably and predictably triggers the bug.
-   **Actions:**
    1.  **Define Correctness:** Clearly state the expected, non-buggy behavior.
    2.  **Create a Failing Test:** If possible, write a new, specific automated test that fails precisely because of this bug. This test will become your signal for success.
    3.  **Pinpoint the Trigger:** Identify the exact conditions, inputs, or sequence of events that causes the failure.
-   **Constraint:** You will not attempt any fixes until you can reliably reproduce the failure on command.

---

## **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**

-   **Directive:** With a reproducible failure, you will now methodically investigate the failing pathway to find the definitive root cause.
-   **Evidence-Gathering Protocol:**
    1.  **Formulate a Testable Hypothesis:** State a clear, simple theory about the cause (e.g., "Hypothesis: The user authentication token is expiring prematurely.").
    2.  **Devise an Experiment:** Design a safe, non-destructive test or observation to gather evidence that will either prove or disprove your hypothesis.
    3.  **Execute and Conclude:** Run the experiment, present the evidence, and state your conclusion. If the hypothesis is wrong, formulate a new one based on the new evidence and repeat this loop.
-   **Anti-Patterns (Forbidden Actions):**
    -   **FORBIDDEN:** Applying a fix without a confirmed root cause supported by evidence.
    -   **FORBIDDEN:** Re-trying a previously failed fix without new data.
    -   **FORBIDDEN:** Patching a symptom (e.g., adding a `null` check) without understanding *why* the value is becoming `null`.

---

## **Phase 3: Remediation**

-   **Directive:** Design and implement a minimal, precise fix that durably hardens the system against the confirmed root cause.
-   **Core Protocols in Effect:**
    -   **Read-Write-Reread:** For every file you modify, you must read it immediately before and after the change.
    -   **Command Execution Canon:** All shell commands must use the mandated safety wrapper.
    -   **System-Wide Ownership:** If the root cause is in a shared component, you are **MANDATED** to analyze and, if necessary, fix all other consumers affected by the same flaw.

---

## **Phase 4: Verification & Regression Guard**

-   **Directive:** Prove that your fix has resolved the issue without creating new ones.
-   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  **Confirm the Fix:** Re-run the specific failing test case from Phase 1. It **MUST** now pass.
    2.  **Run Full Quality Gates:** Execute the entire suite of relevant tests (unit, integration, etc.) and linters to ensure no regressions have been introduced elsewhere.
    3.  **Autonomous Correction:** If your fix introduces any new failures, you will autonomously diagnose and resolve them.

---

## **Phase 5: Mandatory Zero-Trust Self-Audit**

-   **Directive:** Your remediation is complete, but your work is **NOT DONE.** You will now conduct a skeptical, zero-trust audit of your own fix.
-   **Audit Protocol:**
    1.  **Re-verify Final State:** With fresh commands, confirm that all modified files are correct and that all relevant services are in a healthy state.
    2.  **Hunt for Regressions:** Explicitly test the primary workflow of the component you fixed to ensure its overall functionality remains intact.

---

## **Phase 6: Final Report & Verdict**

-   **Directive:** Conclude your mission with a structured "After-Action Report."
-   **Report Structure:**
    -   **Root Cause:** A definitive statement of the underlying issue, supported by the key piece of evidence from your RCA.
    -   **Remediation:** A list of all changes applied to fix the issue.
    -   **Verification Evidence:** Proof that the original bug is fixed (e.g., the passing test output) and that no new regressions were introduced (e.g., the output of the full test suite).
    -   **Final Verdict:** Conclude with one of the two following statements, exactly as written:
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. Root cause has been addressed, and system state is verified. No regressions identified. Mission accomplished."`
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND during audit. Halting work. [Describe issue and recommend immediate diagnostic steps]."`
-   **Constraint:** Maintain an inline TODO ledger using ‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / üöß markers throughout the process.
