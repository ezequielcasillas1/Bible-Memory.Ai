{ üß† What's Likely Happening
The error newWordsFixed is not defined is crashing the handleWordSubmit() function. Because of that:

The app fails to validate the current word.

It doesn‚Äôt increment the word index.

So it keeps showing the same blank, even though you typed something new.

üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Checklist
1. Fix the Missing Variable
In handleWordSubmit() (line 722), define newWordsFixed before using it:

tsx
const newWordsFixed = sanitizeInput(currentWord); // or however you're processing input
2. Check Word Progression Logic
Make sure you're updating the word index after a correct submission:

tsx
if (newWordsFixed === correctWord) {
  setCurrentWordIndex(prev => prev + 1); // ‚úÖ move to next blank
}
3. Verify State Updates
Ensure your state (e.g. currentWordIndex, userInput, wordList) is updating correctly and triggering a re-render:

tsx
useEffect(() => {
  setUserInput(""); // clear input for next word
}, [currentWordIndex]);
4. Check onKeyPress Handler
At line 1462, onKeyPress should call handleWordSubmit() only when Enter is pressed:

tsx
if (e.key === "Enter") {
  handleWordSubmit();
}
‚úÖ What Success Looks Like
Once fixed:

You type a word.

The app checks it.

If correct, it moves to the next blank.

Input resets and progress updates (e.g., ‚ÄúWord 4/5‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúWord 5/5‚Äù).

## **Mission Briefing: Root Cause Analysis & Remediation Protocol**

Previous, simpler attempts to resolve this issue have failed. Standard procedures are now suspended. You will initiate a **deep diagnostic protocol.**

Your approach must be systematic, evidence-based, and relentlessly focused on identifying and fixing the **absolute root cause.** Patching symptoms is a critical failure.

---

## **Phase 0: Reconnaissance & State Baseline (Read-Only)**

-   **Directive:** Adhering to the **Operational Doctrine**, perform a non-destructive scan of the repository, runtime environment, configurations, and recent logs. Your objective is to establish a high-fidelity, evidence-based baseline of the system's current state as it relates to the anomaly.
-   **Output:** Produce a concise digest (‚â§ 200 lines) of your findings.
-   **Constraint:** **No mutations are permitted during this phase.**

---

## **Phase 1: Isolate the Anomaly**

-   **Directive:** Your first and most critical goal is to create a **minimal, reproducible test case** that reliably and predictably triggers the bug.
-   **Actions:**
    1.  **Define Correctness:** Clearly state the expected, non-buggy behavior.
    2.  **Create a Failing Test:** If possible, write a new, specific automated test that fails precisely because of this bug. This test will become your signal for success.
    3.  **Pinpoint the Trigger:** Identify the exact conditions, inputs, or sequence of events that causes the failure.
-   **Constraint:** You will not attempt any fixes until you can reliably reproduce the failure on command.

---

## **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**

-   **Directive:** With a reproducible failure, you will now methodically investigate the failing pathway to find the definitive root cause.
-   **Evidence-Gathering Protocol:**
    1.  **Formulate a Testable Hypothesis:** State a clear, simple theory about the cause (e.g., "Hypothesis: The user authentication token is expiring prematurely.").
    2.  **Devise an Experiment:** Design a safe, non-destructive test or observation to gather evidence that will either prove or disprove your hypothesis.
    3.  **Execute and Conclude:** Run the experiment, present the evidence, and state your conclusion. If the hypothesis is wrong, formulate a new one based on the new evidence and repeat this loop.
-   **Anti-Patterns (Forbidden Actions):**
    -   **FORBIDDEN:** Applying a fix without a confirmed root cause supported by evidence.
    -   **FORBIDDEN:** Re-trying a previously failed fix without new data.
    -   **FORBIDDEN:** Patching a symptom (e.g., adding a `null` check) without understanding *why* the value is becoming `null`.

---

## **Phase 3: Remediation**

-   **Directive:** Design and implement a minimal, precise fix that durably hardens the system against the confirmed root cause.
-   **Core Protocols in Effect:**
    -   **Read-Write-Reread:** For every file you modify, you must read it immediately before and after the change.
    -   **Command Execution Canon:** All shell commands must use the mandated safety wrapper.
    -   **System-Wide Ownership:** If the root cause is in a shared component, you are **MANDATED** to analyze and, if necessary, fix all other consumers affected by the same flaw.

---

## **Phase 4: Verification & Regression Guard**

-   **Directive:** Prove that your fix has resolved the issue without creating new ones.
-   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  **Confirm the Fix:** Re-run the specific failing test case from Phase 1. It **MUST** now pass.
    2.  **Run Full Quality Gates:** Execute the entire suite of relevant tests (unit, integration, etc.) and linters to ensure no regressions have been introduced elsewhere.
    3.  **Autonomous Correction:** If your fix introduces any new failures, you will autonomously diagnose and resolve them.

---

## **Phase 5: Mandatory Zero-Trust Self-Audit**

-   **Directive:** Your remediation is complete, but your work is **NOT DONE.** You will now conduct a skeptical, zero-trust audit of your own fix.
-   **Audit Protocol:**
    1.  **Re-verify Final State:** With fresh commands, confirm that all modified files are correct and that all relevant services are in a healthy state.
    2.  **Hunt for Regressions:** Explicitly test the primary workflow of the component you fixed to ensure its overall functionality remains intact.

---

## **Phase 6: Final Report & Verdict**

-   **Directive:** Conclude your mission with a structured "After-Action Report."
-   **Report Structure:**
    -   **Root Cause:** A definitive statement of the underlying issue, supported by the key piece of evidence from your RCA.
    -   **Remediation:** A list of all changes applied to fix the issue.
    -   **Verification Evidence:** Proof that the original bug is fixed (e.g., the passing test output) and that no new regressions were introduced (e.g., the output of the full test suite).
    -   **Final Verdict:** Conclude with one of the two following statements, exactly as written:
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. Root cause has been addressed, and system state is verified. No regressions identified. Mission accomplished."`
        -   `"Self-Audit Complete. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND during audit. Halting work. [Describe issue and recommend immediate diagnostic steps]."`
-   **Constraint:** Maintain an inline TODO ledger using ‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / üöß markers throughout the process.
