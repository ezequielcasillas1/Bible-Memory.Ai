/**
 * WORD SKIPPING BUG REPRODUCTION TEST
 * 
 * Based on Romans 8:28 screenshot:
 * "And we know ____ in all ____ God ____ for the ____ of ____ who love him..."
 * 
 * EXPECTED PROGRESSION:
 * 1. User completes "know" ‚úÖ
 * 2. Next blank should be the yellow one after "know" 
 * 3. Then "in all", then "God", etc. (left-to-right)
 * 
 * ACTUAL BUG:
 * 1. User completes "know" ‚úÖ  
 * 2. System SKIPS the next blank
 * 3. "God" becomes active instead (wrong!)
