# ðŸš€ Cursor Agent Commit & Push Guide (Main Branch Only)

This document defines **best practices** for Cursor (or any AI agent) when working in this repo.  
The goal is to ensure **every code change is properly staged, committed, and pushed to `main`**.

{IMPORTANT RIGHT AFTER ADDING COMMIT, DO NOT PUSH, UNTIL I VERIFY THAT IT IS WORKING, I WILL 
LET YOU KNOW IF IT DOES NOT WORK, AND IF IT DOES NOT WORK THEN ILL LET YOU KNOW BY TELLING YOU
TO PUT IN THE UPDATED COMMIT WITH THE TITLE/DESCRIPTION: DOES NOT WORK. THEN FEEL FREE TO ALWAYS PUSH IT AFTERWARDS}

## ðŸ”¹ Golden Rules

1. **Never delete sensitive files**:
   - `.env`, API keys, secrets, database files, or configs.
   - If changes are needed, comment them or mock them instead.

2. **Always stage only intentional changes**:
   - Use `git add .` to include all modifications **only after validating they belong to the feature**.
   - Never commit system files like `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, or local logs.

3. **Always commit after a change is made**:
   - Each commit should have a **clear message**.
   - Format:
     ```
     [Tag] Short Description
     ```
   - Examples:
     ```
     BM1.7 IMPROVED UI
     chore: remove unused imports
     fix: corrected verse translation bug
     ```

4. **Always push directly to `main`**:
   - No feature branches for standard changes.
   - After every commit, push to `main`.

## ðŸ”¹ Standard Commit Flow

Every time a feature or file is added/updated:

```bash
# 1. Sync with remote first
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Stage all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "BMx.x <FEATURE SUMMARY>"

# 4. Push to remote main
git push origin main
